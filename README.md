This notebook allows one to explore relationships between solar bodies and the roles they play (if any) on the magnitude and occurrence of earthquakes >= 5.5. I am new to Python and Machine & Deep Learning. This is by no means complete. I plan to introduce sea level data and angular velocity over time. I would like to try some linear regression on coordinates and magnitude labels as well.
Feedback is greatly appreciated!
